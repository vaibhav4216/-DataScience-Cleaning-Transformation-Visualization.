# Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Visualization Project

This project demonstrates basic data science tasks including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The goal is to preprocess a dataset, transform it for analysis, and visualize key features. This project is divided into three main tasks, each with a corresponding Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:
- **Task1-DataCleaning.ipynb** - Notebook for data cleaning.
- **Task2-DataTransformation.ipynb** - Notebook for data transformation.
- **Task3-DataVisualization.ipynb** - Notebook for data visualization.
- **README.md** - Project documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
